It also helps if the camera has zoom, as most P&amp;amp;S cameras do. The problem with creating a shallow depth of field comes from the fact that the sensor is so small, and as a result the lens is close to the sensor — thus creating very small focal lengths. My P&amp;amp;S has a focal length range from 6mm to 18mm — which is very small. They create an effective focal length much higher due to the small sensor size. As I said in the tips, a short focal length will produce an image with nearly everything in focus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;So to blur the background using a P&amp;amp;S, you’ll get your best results if you zoom in all the way, focus on something close (you don’t want to focus out to infinity), and have a background that is much further away. So your two points of control are focal length and subject distance.

Its an excellent quality lens and a good performer. It has an f/4 aperture, which while ok for general lighting, will not perform as well in more fringe lighting scenarios like indoor sports, morning/evening, or night shooting. The 28-135 lens is very similar, but is one of Canon's middle-grade lines. Its quality is not quite as good as an L-series. It does offer a slightly larger aperture at f/3.5, but it is not constant, and closes down to f/5.6 as you zoom. It does offer slightly greater zoom range, however, which may be useful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for a single lens that is truly multi-purpose, and will cover any situation you may find yourself in, then there is also a large zoom range lens for that as well.

It has one of the largest zoom ranges in existence at 11x zoom. This lens, at the short end of 28mm, is not particularly wide with an f/3.5 aperture. However, as it extends towars the 300mm long end, an f/5.6 aperture is not too bad. The quality of this lens is pretty good throughout its range, although it certainly is not as good as a 300mm or 28mm prime. Given that it is a single lens, it is highly adaptable for a broad range of situations, allowing you to take one lens and leave the rest at home.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Canon lenses usually come with a price premium, and there are some other brands that offer similar lenses at similar quality, and cheaper cost.

There are a variety of crop factors, and depending on the camera manufacturer, they differ.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Canon generally has three sensor sizes in its DSLR camera: full-frame (1x), APS-H (1.3x), and APS-X (1.6x). Most of canon's cameras make use of an APS-C style sensor, and have a 1.6x crop factor. Few of canon's cameras use an APS-H or FF sensor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Crop factor, while interesting from a sensor size perspective, has a more useful meaning. If you take a shot of a scene with the same lens in the same location with both a FF and an APS-C camera, the 1.6x crop factor causes the photo from the APS-C to appear &quot;more zoomed&quot;. If we assume that you took the photo with a 50mm lens, the FF 1x image would appear correct for a 50mm lens, but the APS-C 1.6x image would appear as though it was from an 80mm lens. (Simply multiply the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; focal length by the crop factor to get the &lt;em&gt;effective&lt;/em&gt; focal length.)

The .6/.9 describes the number of stops of light it filters, and the hard or soft describes how the edge is feathered.  He said for water shots of sunsets on the horizon, he even uses a reverse GND - where the bottom half is clear, the darkest part is dead center, and it trails off to clear at the top.

As you can imagine, my heart nearly stopped when it happened. I've taken the most effective approach I can think of to resolve the problem. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I purchased a ReadyNas NVX, a network attached storage device. The ReadyNAS NVX is a very nice, compact 4-bay raid device that hooks directly into your home network. It can hold a considerable amount of space (currently holds 4 2Tb drives for a total of 8Gb, with about 2Gb used for redundancy and protection), and is very, very fast. I was able to transfer a couple Tb of data to this puppy in about 3 hours at a rate of 60mb/s. Reading from the drive is amazingly fast, peaking at around 85mb/s, and rarely dropping below 75mb/s.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The beauty of a device like the ReadyNAX NVX is that it supports dynamically expanding your storage. If you start out with just one 2Tb hard drive, you can easily expand that to 4Tb by adding another drive while the device is running. If you have 8Tb with 4 2Tb drives, you can pull one drive out and replace it with a 4Tb drive, and the system will automatically expand your space. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that a NAS/Raid device like this is not sufficient as a sole, permanent backup. In addition to the NVX, I also regularly burn my photography work to BluRay discs.

I'm a DSLR user, but there are many scenarios where shooting without an ND filter is just not possible. In my extensive exploration of ND filters, I've found Lee Filters. Both from a textbook technical perspective, and in reality, Lee seems to have the best filters available. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of the things I've learned about ND filters are that you need flexibility in how they are situated in front of your lens (particularly for ND Grad filters), and quality of filtration. A lot of other brands don't filter all ranges of light...they filter the &quot;central&quot; bulk of visible light, but allow either infrared or ultraviolet wavelengths to slip through. This can give an undesired color cast to your images...either warming them or cooling them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lee filters are solid filters that don't leave much of a color cast, and they have a very broad range of stops, anything from a few stops up through their &quot;Big Stopper&quot;, a whopping 10-stop filter. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In regards to which kind of filter you get, you will ultimately probably need both solid and graduated filters. One of the most useful purposes for an ND Grad filter is to balance the contrast in a scene, and depending on the scene, you may want a hard ND grad, or a soft ND grad. If you have a sharp horizon with a very bright sky, a hard ND grad will serve you well. If you have a softer or less defined horizon, such as a mountain landscape, a soft ND grad will probably be better. The most common &lt;a href=&quot;http://leefilters.com/index.php/camera/ndgrads&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ND grad filters&lt;/a&gt; I have seen in use, and the ones I've purchased for myself, are the 0.6 and 0.9 (or 2 and 3 stop).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you wish to greatly slow down the rate at which light reaches your sensor, by that 10-20 seconds, you'll likely need a high-stop solid ND filter.

Camera sensors have a limited range of contrast that they can capture, around 5-6 stops. If the difference in exposure value between the darkest and brightest part of a scene is greater than 5-6 stops, you need to compensate.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Use graduated neutral density (ND) filters to compensate when contrast range is too great for your sensor.

That's caused either by the motion of the subject, or the motion of the camera (including camera shake and vibration).

It's also not necessarily bad; some blur can help imply motion on the part of the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Out of focus&quot; is used to describe problems with the distance between subject and sensor, given a particular lens focus setting. Most of the time you want your subject to be in complete focus. Depth of field (which is controlled by aperture) can help achieve this. However, most of the results are determined by the focusing system itself, either you (for manual focus) or the autofocus system of your camera. The latter can be quite complex and tricky in low-light; different cameras and lenses will have different behaviors. That's why you'll often see the little light from your camera turn on before a shot; the AF system needs a minimum level of light in order to do its work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They're two different things and require two different types of corrections.
